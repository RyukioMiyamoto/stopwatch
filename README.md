<h1> Overview </h1>

Project developed from scratch with the purpose of fixating javascript concepts like DOM manipulation, event bubbling and built-in methods.

The app main functionality is a stopwatch with two buttons and 4 actions available: Start, Stop, Resume and Reset.

With users prone to motion sickness in mind, the animations (which includes milliseconds display due to its fast nature) don't show if they have motion reduced setting on.
